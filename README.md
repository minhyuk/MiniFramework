Proof of concept for Convey pattern for small software design &amp; usable libraries adapt for Convey pattern


Convey Pattern
=============

It looks like Chain pattern[1], but Convey Pattern has strong typed and more focused on referenced object itself.
Main Idea tooks from factory's convey line. Goods are made up through convey line's each workers.

You can do this with generic type and chain pattern.

First time I invented this pattern, I have plan to use for compilation process. 
This process run first with source file path, and compile options.
After one step forward it generate preprocessed file from previous input.
And after one step forward again, it generate parse tree(AST) from previous input... and go on.

This kind processing mechanism also applied various software engineering. I believe.
